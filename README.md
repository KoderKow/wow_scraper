# wow_scraper

The motivation behind this project was started with one of the Hackathons held through the Health Data Science program at IUPUI. The advisor, Spencer Lourens, introduced web scraping with R. Being interested in the subject after the session Professor Lourens said he thought web scraping the World of Warcraft weapons would be really awesome. With his permission, I proceeded to make one.

The main goal of this project was to learn how to use the R libraries rvest and RSelenium. The web scraping would be taking place on the website wowhead.com, there would be about 10,000 rows of data to collect. This started off as a basic project, but it turned into being a slightly advanced web scraping script.
